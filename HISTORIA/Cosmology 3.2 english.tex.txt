% ABSTRACT
%------------------------------------------------

\begin{abstract}
We present a finite-memory stochastic cosmology framework in which the dark energy
equation of state exhibits damped log-oscillations driven by self-consistent stochastic
noise. The effective equation of state is parametrized as
\begin{equation}
    w(z) = -1 + A \, e^{-z/z_\tau}
    \cos\bigl[ \omega \ln(1+z) + \delta \bigr],
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the oscillation amplitude, $\omega$ is a frequency in logarithmic redshift,
$\delta$ is a phase, and $z_\tau = c \Hzero \tau$ encodes a finite memory time $\tau$.
At the microscopic level, the model is derived from two interacting scalar fields
subjected to Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noise with intensity proportional to the
Gibbons--Hawking temperature $\TGH = H / 2\pi$, modulated by a geometric
window function that suppresses noise at high redshift.

We define Model~2.1.1 as the most conservative observationally viable
implementation of this framework: the amplitude is restricted to $A \leq 0.03$
and the noise intensity is regulated by a sigmoidal cutoff $S(z)$ activated
around $z_c \sim 4$. This ensures compatibility with current constraints from
type Ia supernovae, BAO, and the CMB, while retaining a non-trivial temporal
structure in $w(z)$ at low redshift. The model is explicitly falsifiable through a
Bayesian comparison with $\Lambda$CDM using public data (Pantheon+ and
follow-up datasets), and is accompanied by an open validation pipeline.

This article consolidates the theoretical framework, the observational
parametrization, and the empirical validation protocol into a single
self-contained preprint intended for independent scrutiny and extension.

\section{Introduction}
%------------------------------------------------

The nature of dark energy remains one of the central open problems in modern
cosmology. While the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ provides an excellent
phenomenological fit to current data, it leaves fundamental questions about the
origin and dynamics of cosmic acceleration unresolved. A broad family of
alternatives introduce dynamical degrees of freedom, modified gravity, or
phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation of state
\cite{Copeland:2006wr,Tsujikawa:2013fta}.

In this work we explore a different direction, motivated by stochastic
processes and finite-memory effects. Rather than treating dark energy as a
static fluid or a purely deterministic scalar field, we consider a framework
where its effective equation of state $w(z)$ exhibits damped oscillations driven
by colored noise with finite correlation time. The key idea is that the interplay
between memory and fluctuation can leave a small but potentially observable
temporal structure in the late-time expansion history.

The present paper consolidates and extends previous notes on
\emph{stochastic cosmology with finite memory} into a single, self-contained
preprint. We (i) formulate the underlying stochastic model in terms of
scalar fields coupled to a Gibbons--Hawking temperature, (ii) derive an
effective log-oscillatory parametrization for $w(z)$, (iii) define a
conservative observational implementation (Model~2.1.1), and (iv) present
an explicit empirical validation protocol based on publicly available data.

Throughout this work we adopt natural units $c = \hbar = k_{\mathrm{B}} = 8\pi G = 1$
unless otherwise stated.

\section{Stochastic Dark Energy with Finite Memory}
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Microscopic framework}

We consider a flat Friedmann--Robertson--Walker (FRW) background with scale
factor $a(t)$ and Hubble rate $H = \dot{a}/a$. Dark energy is modeled as an
effective fluid emerging from two interacting scalar fields $\phi$ and $\chi$,
subjected to colored stochastic forces. The equations for small deviations of
the effective equation of state $w$ from the cosmological constant value $-1$
can be written schematically as
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\zeta}_\phi = -\frac{\zeta_\phi}{\tau_\phi}
    + \sqrt{\frac{2 \Gamma_\phi \TGH}{\tau_\phi^2}} \, \xi_\phi(t),
    \qquad
    \dot{\zeta}_\chi = -\frac{\zeta_\chi}{\tau_\chi}
    + \sqrt{\frac{2 \Gamma_\chi \TGH}{\tau_\chi^2}} \, \xi_\chi(t),
    \label{eq:OU-original}
\end{equation}
where $\zeta_{\phi,\chi}$ encode deviations in the effective dark energy
sector, $\tau_{\phi,\chi}$ are memory (correlation) times, $\Gamma_i$ are
dimensionless couplings, and $\xi_i(t)$ are independent Gaussian white noise
terms with
\begin{equation}
    \langle \xi_i(t) \rangle = 0, \qquad
    \langle \xi_i(t) \xi_j(t') \rangle = \delta_{ij}\, \delta(t-t').
\end{equation}
The noise intensity is proportional to the Gibbons--Hawking temperature
\begin{equation}
    \TGH = \frac{H}{2\pi},
\end{equation}
reflecting the coupling between the dark energy sector and the horizon
thermodynamics. In the simplest implementation we take
$\Gamma_i = \alpha_i 3 H$ with $\alpha_i = \mathcal{O}(1)$, so that the
noise amplitude is self-consistently tied to the expansion rate.

\subsection{Geometric noise cutoff}

In the original version of the model, the stochastic forcing
\eqref{eq:OU-original} remains active at arbitrarily high redshift, which can
lead to excessive fluctuations incompatible with the observed smoothness of
the CMB. To avoid this, we introduce a \emph{geometric cutoff} that suppresses
the noise in the early Universe and activates it only when dark energy becomes
dynamically relevant.

We define an effective temperature
\begin{equation}
    T_{\mathrm{eff}}(z) \equiv \TGH(z)\, S(z),
\end{equation}
where $S(z)$ is a dimensionless window function. In the minimal
realization (Model~2.1.1) we adopt a smooth sigmoidal profile
\begin{equation}
    S(z) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\bigl[(z - z_c)/\Delta z\bigr]},
    \label{eq:Sz-sigmoid}
\end{equation}
with transition parameters $z_c \sim 4$ and $\Delta z \sim 0.5$.

Figure~\ref{fig:cutoff} shows the behavior of $S(z)$ for different values of $z_c$.
This choice ensures that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At high redshift ($z \gg z_c$), $S(z) \to 0$ and the noise is effectively switched off.
    \item Around $z \simeq z_c$, $S(z) \simeq 1/2$ and the stochastic driving turns on smoothly.
    \item At low redshift ($z \ll z_c$), $S(z) \to 1$ and the full stochastic dynamics is active.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figura2_cutoff_geometrico.pdf}
\caption{Geometric noise suppression window $S(z)$. The nominal configuration 
($z_c=4.0$, $\Delta z=0.5$, blue solid) activates noise smoothly at late times while 
preserving CMB compatibility. Early/late activation scenarios (dashed) illustrate 
parameter sensitivity.}
\label{fig:cutoff}
\end{figure}

The modified Ornstein--Uhlenbeck equations become
\begin{align}
    \dot{\zeta}_\phi &= -\frac{\zeta_\phi}{\tau_\phi}
    + S\bigl(z(t)\bigr) \sqrt{\frac{2 \Gamma_\phi \TGH(t)}{\tau_\phi^2}} \, \xi_\phi(t),
    \label{eq:OU-cutoff-phi}
    \\
    \dot{\zeta}_\chi &= -\frac{\zeta_\chi}{\tau_\chi}
    + S\bigl(z(t)\bigr) \sqrt{\frac{2 \Gamma_\chi \TGH(t)}{\tau_\chi^2}} \, \xi_\chi(t),
    \label{eq:OU-cutoff-chi}
\end{align}
where the explicit time dependence $z(t)$ is determined by the background
expansion.

For numerical purposes, it is often convenient to rewrite the system in terms
of redshift $z$ as the evolution variable, using
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\dd z}{\dd t} = -H(z)\,(1+z).
\end{equation}
The stochastic equations then transform into
\begin{align}
    \frac{\dd \zeta_\phi}{\dd z} &=
    \frac{1}{H(z)\,(1+z)}\left[
        -\frac{\zeta_\phi}{\tau_\phi}
        + S(z) \sqrt{\frac{2 \Gamma_\phi \TGH(z)}{\tau_\phi^2}}\, \xi_\phi(z)
    \right],
    \\
    \frac{\dd \zeta_\chi}{\dd z} &=
    \frac{1}{H(z)\,(1+z)}\left[
        -\frac{\zeta_\chi}{\tau_\chi}
        + S(z) \sqrt{\frac{2 \Gamma_\chi \TGH(z)}{\tau_\chi^2}}\, \xi_\chi(z)
    \right],
\end{align}
with redshift-normalized noise $\xi_i(z)$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
    \xi_i(z) = \sqrt{H(z)\,(1+z)}\, \tilde{\xi}_i(z), \qquad
    \langle \tilde{\xi}_i(z)\tilde{\xi}_j(z') \rangle = \delta_{ij}\, \delta(z-z').
\end{equation}

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Effective Log-Oscillatory Equation of State}
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Parametrization}

The coarse-grained effect of the stochastic dynamics described above can be
captured by an effective equation of state for dark energy of the form
\begin{equation}
    w(z) = -1 + A \, e^{-z/z_\tau}
    \cos\bigl[ \omega \ln(1+z) + \delta \bigr],
    \label{eq:wz-param}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillations,
    \item $\omega$ is the oscillation frequency in logarithmic redshift,
    \item $\delta$ is an initial phase,
    \item $z_\tau$ encodes the finite memory depth via $z_\tau = c\, \Hzero \tau$.
\end{itemize}
The exponential factor $e^{-z/z_\tau}$ ensures that the oscillations are
damped towards high redshift, consistent with the suppression of stochastic
effects in the early Universe.

Figure~\ref{fig:wz} illustrates the behavior of $w(z)$ for different values of
the amplitude $A$, showing smooth log-oscillations around the $\Lambda$CDM
value $w=-1$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figura1_wz_amplitudes.pdf}
\caption{Equation of state $w(z)$ for different oscillation amplitudes. The model
exhibits damped log-periodic deviations from $\Lambda$CDM ($A=0$, dashed black).
The conservative bound $A \leq 0.03$ (red) ensures observational viability while
preserving finite-memory structure.}
\label{fig:wz}
\end{figure}

In Bayesian analyses we recommend a truncated Gaussian prior for $A$,
\begin{equation}
    A \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_A^2) \quad \text{truncated to} \quad [0, A_{\max}],
\end{equation}
with $A_{\max} \equiv 0.03$ (see Section~\ref{sec:model-211}). This favors
smooth deviations from $w=-1$ at the few-percent level, in agreement with
current observational bounds, while preserving the structure implied by the
microscopic model.

\subsection{Background evolution}

The effective dark energy fluid enters the Friedmann equation through
\begin{equation}
    H^2(z) = \Hzero^2 \left[
        \Omegam (1+z)^3 + \Omegal \exp\left(
        3 \int_0^z \frac{1 + w(z')}{1+z'} \dd z' \right)
    \right],
    \label{eq:Friedmann-wz}
\end{equation}
where flatness implies $\Omegal = 1 - \Omegam$.
For given parameters $(A,\omega,\delta,\tau\Hzero)$, the integral in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:Friedmann-wz} can be evaluated numerically by interpolating
$w(z)$ on a suitable redshift grid.

The luminosity distance follows as
\begin{equation}
    d_L(z) = c (1+z) \int_0^z \frac{\dd z'}{H(z')},
\end{equation}
leading to the observable distance modulus
\begin{equation}
    \mu(z) = 5 \log_{10} \left( \frac{d_L(z)}{\text{Mpc}} \right) + 25.
\end{equation}

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Model 2.1.1: Reduced Amplitude and Geometric Cutoff}
\label{sec:model-211}
%------------------------------------------------

Model~2.1.1 is defined as an observationally conservative realization of the
finite-memory stochastic cosmology framework, incorporating:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A restricted amplitude range
    \begin{equation}
        0 \leq A \leq A_{\max}, \qquad A_{\max} = 0.03,
    \end{equation}
    with a truncated Gaussian prior $\sigma_A \simeq 0.02$.
    \item A geometric cutoff $S(z)$ in the noise intensity, as in
    Eq.~\eqref{eq:Sz-sigmoid}, with fiducial values
    \begin{equation}
        z_c \sim 4, \qquad \Delta z \sim 0.5.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

These choices are motivated by the following considerations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Large-amplitude oscillations ($A \gtrsim 0.1$) are strongly disfavored
    by existing constraints from type Ia supernovae and BAO.
    \item A high-redshift cutoff in the stochastic forcing is required to avoid
    excessive structure in the CMB power spectrum.
    \item A smooth transition in $S(z)$ reduces numerical artifacts and
    corresponds to a physically gradual activation of noise as dark energy
    becomes dynamically relevant.
\end{itemize}

In practice, Model~2.1.1 can be fully specified by the parameter vector
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\theta} = \{A, \omega, \delta, \tau\Hzero, \Omegam, \Hzero\},
\end{equation}
with priors such as
\begin{align}
    &0 \leq A \leq 0.03, \\
    &1 \lesssim \omega \lesssim 5, \\
    &0 \leq \delta < 2\pi, \\
    &0.5 \lesssim \tau\Hzero \lesssim 5, \\
    &\Omegam \sim \mathcal{N}(0.315, 0.02^2), \\
    &\Hzero \sim \mathcal{N}(70\,\text{km/s/Mpc}, 3^2).
\end{align}
These ranges can be refined in future analyses.

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Resilience Windows and the Finite-Memory Conjecture}
%------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Emergent stability parameter}

Numerical analysis of the stochastic system reveals an emergent dimensionless
parameter that controls dynamical stability:
\begin{equation}
    \Rmem = \tau \Omega,
    \label{eq:R-definition}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is the correlation time of the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck noise and
$\Omega$ is the characteristic oscillation frequency. This product encodes
the number of oscillation periods over which the system retains memory.

Monte Carlo simulations of the full stochastic equations suggest that the
system exhibits minimal variance and maximal stability when
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{0.5 \lesssim \Rmem \lesssim 3.5}
    \label{eq:resilience-window}
\end{equation}
as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:valley}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figura3_valle_resiliencia.pdf}
\caption{Resilience valley in $(\tau H_0, \omega)$ parameter space. The surface
shows attractor variance as computed from Monte Carlo realizations. The red line
marks the optimal trajectory $R = \tau H_0 \cdot \omega = 2$. Black bars indicate
the resilience band $R \in [0.5, 3.5]$ where variance is minimized.}
\label{fig:valley}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tentative generalization}

The existence of a preferred band in $\Rmem$ suggests a possible general
principle for dissipative systems with memory and oscillation. We conjecture
--- tentatively and subject to empirical testing in multiple domains --- that
systems characterized by a finite correlation time $\tau$ and a dominant
frequency $\Omega$ achieve maximal resilience (defined operationally as
minimal variance, maximal coherence, or negative Lyapunov exponent) when
\begin{equation}
    \Rmem = \tau \Omega \in [0.5,\, 3.5].
\end{equation}
This \emph{Finite Memory Law} (FML) is not presented as an established
universal principle but as an empirical observation from the cosmological
model that invites cross-domain validation.

We emphasize that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The cosmological validation presented here is necessary but not
    sufficient to establish FML as a general principle.
    \item Extension to other systems (neural oscillations, machine learning
    dynamics, fluid turbulence) requires independent controlled experiments.
    \item The conjecture is explicitly falsifiable: if multiple domains show
    optimal stability outside $[0.5, 3.5]$ with high statistical significance,
    FML is refuted.
\end{itemize}

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Observational Predictions}
%------------------------------------------------

Model~2.1.1 yields several qualitative and quantitative predictions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Smooth oscillations in $w(z)$.} Deviations from $w=-1$ are at the
    few-percent level, with oscillations concentrated at $z \lesssim 2$.

    \item \textbf{Compatibility with CMB at high redshift.} The geometric cutoff $S(z)$
    suppresses stochastic effects for $z \gtrsim 4$, avoiding conflict with the
    smoothness of the primordial spectrum.

    \item \textbf{Late-time Integrated Sachs--Wolfe (ISW) signal.}
    The modulated $w(z)$ induces small oscillatory features in the growth of
    the gravitational potential at $z \lesssim 2$, potentially imprinting
    structure in CMB--LSS cross-correlations.

    \item \textbf{Finite-memory band.} Bayesian posterior for $\tau\Hzero$ and
    $\omega$ should concentrate near the resilience window, with the product
    $\Rmem = \tau\Hzero \cdot \omega$ peaking in $[0.5, 3.5]$ if the model
    is correct.

    \item \textbf{Falsifiability via Bayesian comparison.} A joint analysis of
    Pantheon+ SNe Ia, BAO and low-$z$ CMB constraints can falsify the model if
    the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) favors $\Lambda$CDM by
    $\Delta\mathrm{BIC} > 10$ in a robust manner.
\end{enumerate}

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Empirical Validation Protocol (Summary)}
%------------------------------------------------

A full operational protocol for validating the model using public data is
provided in a companion implementation (to be released on GitHub). Here we
summarize the main steps for the minimal viable analysis with Pantheon+
supernovae:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Download and clean the Pantheon+ dataset (1701 SNe Ia, $0.01 < z < 2.3$).
    \item Implement the model $w(z)$ as in Eq.~\eqref{eq:wz-param} and compute
    $\mu(z)$ for each set of parameters $\bm{\theta}$, using numerical
    integration of Eq.~\eqref{eq:Friedmann-wz}.
    \item Define a Gaussian likelihood
    \begin{equation}
        \ln \mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta}) =
        -\frac{1}{2}\sum_i \left(
            \frac{\mu_i^{\mathrm{obs}} - \mu(z_i; \bm{\theta})}{\sigma_i}
        \right)^2,
    \end{equation}
    with $\sigma_i$ the observational uncertainties.
    \item Sample the posterior $\mathcal{P}(\bm{\theta}\mid \text{data})$ using
    an MCMC sampler such as \texttt{emcee} \cite{ForemanMackey:2013}.
    \item Compute the best-fit $\chi^2$ and the BIC for both Model~2.1.1 and
    $\Lambda$CDM, and evaluate $\Delta \mathrm{BIC}$.
    \item Inspect the posterior for $A$, $\tau\Hzero$, $\omega$ to check whether
    the finite-memory prediction $\Rmem \in [0.5, 3.5]$ is supported.
\end{enumerate}

A negative result (e.g.\ $A$ consistent with zero and strong preference for
$\Lambda$CDM) would \emph{refute} the current formulation of the model and is
considered as scientifically valuable as a positive detection.

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Discussion}
%------------------------------------------------

The finite-memory stochastic cosmology framework sits at the interface between
cosmology, stochastic processes and dynamical systems with feedback. By
introducing an explicit correlation time $\tau$ and self-consistent noise
intensity proportional to $\TGH$, the model suggests that late-time cosmic
acceleration may exhibit small temporal structures rather than being exactly
constant.

Beyond cosmology, the same combination of finite memory and oscillatory
dynamics appears in multiple domains, from damped oscillators to cortical
oscillations and machine learning optimization. This motivates the broader
Finite Memory Law conjecture, in which the dimensionless product
$\Rmem = \tau \Omega$ lies in a resilience band $\Rmem \in [0.5, 3.5]$ for a
wide class of systems. The present work focuses on the cosmological sector;
multi-domain validation is deferred to future studies.

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Limitations and Future Work}
%------------------------------------------------

This work has several important limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The present analysis focuses on the background expansion history.
    A full treatment including perturbations and CMB anisotropies has not
    yet been carried out.
    \item The potential of the underlying scalar fields and their couplings
    are treated effectively; a fully microscopic Lagrangian derivation is
    left open.
    \item Only minimal priors and a restricted dataset (Pantheon+ SNe Ia)
    are considered in the baseline empirical protocol. A robust assessment
    requires combining BAO, CMB, growth of structure and lensing data.
    \item The connection to the broader Finite Memory Law across domains
    remains conjectural and is based on toy models and dimensional analysis.
\end{itemize}

Future work will address these limitations by:
(i) implementing the model in Boltzmann solvers to confront CMB and LSS data,
(ii) exploring alternative forms of the geometric cutoff $S(z)$,
(iii) performing a joint Bayesian analysis with DESI, Planck and weak lensing
datasets, and (iv) extending the finite-memory analysis to controlled
experiments in other dynamical systems.

%------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusions}
%------------------------------------------------

We have presented a self-consistent finite-memory stochastic cosmology model
in which dark energy exhibits damped log-oscillations in its equation of state,
driven by Gibbons--Hawking--coupled noise with a geometric cutoff. The
observationally conservative Model~2.1.1 restricts the oscillation amplitude
and regulates high-redshift noise, yielding a viable candidate for empirical
testing against current and future data.

The framework is explicitly falsifiable and designed to be tested by
independent researchers using public datasets and open-source code. Regardless
of the outcome, the model provides a concrete example of how finite-memory
effects can be integrated into cosmological dynamics, and may inspire similar
approaches in other areas of physics and complex systems.
